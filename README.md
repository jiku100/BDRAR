# BDRAR
Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network with Recurrent Attention Residual Modules for Shadow Detection


# Preparation
1. Set the path of pretrained ResNeXt model in resnext/config.py
2. Set the path of SBU dataset in config.py

The pretrained ResNeXt model is ported from the official torch version, using the convertor provided by clcarwin. You can directly download the pretrained model ported by me.
